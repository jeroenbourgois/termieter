# ---- [ Configuration ] ----
#

escape ^Zz # Instead of Control-a, make the escape/command character be Control-z (Ctrl-A is already a BASH command)

autodetach on 			# Autodetach session on hangup instead of terminating screen completely

startup_message off 		# Turn off the splash screen

defscrollback 30000 		# Use a 30000-line scrollback buffer ... the default is small

termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@	# From http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~jnweiger/screen-faq.html
				# # Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
				# # A: The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate 
				#      text buffer is selected. The standard definitions of the termcap 
				#      initialize capabilities ti and te switch to and from the alternate 
				#      text buffer. (The scrollbar also does not work when you start e.g. ‘vi’). 
				#      You can tell screen not to use these initialisations by adding the line 
				#      “termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@” to your ~/.screenrc file. 

pow_detach_msg "Screen session of \$LOGNAME \$:cr:\$:nl:ended." 	# A more useful message when detached, so you know how to get back!
